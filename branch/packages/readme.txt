Installing the Suite Components
===============================

The suite consists of a number of individual components each with its own installation.

Please run each of the separate installations to install the components.

The SAML v1.1 component supports the SAML v1.1 specification only.

The SAML v2.0 component supports the SAML v2.0 specification only.

If you wish to support both SAML v1.1 and SAML v2.0 in your application then you need to
use both components.
